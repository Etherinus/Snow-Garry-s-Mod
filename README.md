# Snow System for Garry's Mod

This script adds snow to Garry's Mod, creating a winter landscape atmosphere. Snow falls from the sky, covers surfaces, and adds fog for greater realism.

## Installation

1. Download the `snow.lua` file.
2. Place the `snow.lua` file in the `lua/autorun/client` folder of your Garry's Mod. This will ensure the script is automatically loaded when the game starts.

   The folder path may look like this: GarrysMod/garrysmod/lua/autorun/client/snow.lua

## How to Enable and Disable Snow

Snow can be enabled or disabled using a console command:

- Enable snow: enablesnow

- Disable snow: enablesnow

The `enablesnow` command toggles the snow state: if snow was enabled, it will be disabled, and vice versa.

## Settings

The script has several settings that can be adjusted using console commands:

- **Snow Density**: Controls the number of snowflakes on the screen. snowflakes_enabled 1 (1 — enabled, 0 — disabled)

## Features

- **Snowflakes**: Snowflakes fall from the sky and react to wind.
- **Surface Coverage**: Certain surfaces (e.g., grass, dirt, paper) are replaced with snow textures.
- **Fog**: Fog is added to create a winter landscape atmosphere.

## Notes

- If you reload the map or scripts, the snow will automatically be disabled, and textures will be restored.

## Author

The script was created for Garry's Mod and can be modified or improved depending on your needs.
